				A vast reservoir of information on human health and behavior lies in our sewage, and yet it remains untapped. We imagine a future in which sewage is mined for real-time information that can inform policy makers, health practitioners, designers, and researchers alike. Such is the idea behind Underworlds: a cross-disciplinary, open-data platform for monitoring urban health patterns, shaping more inclusive public health strategies, and pushing the boundaries of urban epidemiology. Pioneered by the Senseable City Lab and the Alm Lab, a prototype smart sewage platform is being developed at MIT consisting of physical infrastructure, biochemical measurement technologies, and the downstream computational tools and analytics necessary to interpret and act on our findings. 
				<br><br>
				The Underworlds project is the first of its kind, and a proof of concept that cities can make use of their waste water system to do near real-time urban epidemiology and understand human health and behavior with a fine spatio-temporal resolution. Probably the most obvious first application of smart sewage technology is contagious disease surveillance, and the prediction of outbreaks of infectious disease before symptoms arise.

				Early warnings in relation to the presence of new flu strains in urban centers could significantly reduce a communityâ€™s medical costs, save lives and help prevent pandemics. In addition, smart sewage could change the way non-communicable diseases are studied, because biomarkers for diseases such as obesity and diabetes can be measured at unprecedented scale and temporal resolution.
				<br><br>
				The implications of this platform extend beyond just disease surveillance to the development of a new type of human population census. Analyzed in tandem with demographic data, this platform can study the aggregate health of a city to the particular health of a neighborhood. Underworlds will study the geographic morphology, network topology, and demographic distribution in conjunction with wastewater loads over time, to propose and validate a model that informs wastewater sampling and correlates to target population samples. This work has already started in a pilot study in Boston. In collaboration with the Department of Public Works, the geographic and topological character of the sewage tributary network in several communities in and around the city have been analyzed along with demographic data to develop a sampling strategy for maximum coverage and optimal population sample.
